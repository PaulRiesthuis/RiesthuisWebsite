abstract: "In this registered report, we propose a meta-analysis of laboratory studies that will examine the size of the impact of forced confabulation on false memory formation. To carry out the literature search, we will use the PRISMA workflow and the following databases and repositories: PsycINFO, PsycArticles, all editions of Web of Science Core Collection, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Open Science Framework and PsycArXiv. The meta-analysis will use a random effects model and the effect size indicator Hedges gâ€™ to estimate the mean effect size. Additionally, heterogeneity between studies will be scrutinized and elaborated upon if the I2 statistic surpasses a low to medium amount of heterogeneity (40%). Moreover, via a z-curve analysis, funnel plots inspection, and the trim-and-fill procedure, we will address possible publication bias. This meta-analysis is the first to establish the strength of the forced confabulation effect and might provide timely knowledge on how self-generated confabulation can affect the proneness to form false memories."

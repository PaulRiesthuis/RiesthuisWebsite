Abstract: In the legal context, it is possible that people decide wither to lie about an experienced event or avoid reporting their version of the event. There are different ways of lying and these lies that affect memory differently. For example, suspects might feign memory loss for their crime, while victims might falsely deny being abused. In this paper, we will review studies concerning the way the act of lying can affect liarsâ€™ memories for the actual occurred event. In particular, we will explain how deceptive strategies, such as false denials, feigned amnesia and fabrication, impact memory. Moreover, we will provide theoretical explanations concerning the mechanisms underpinning such mnemonic effects. Practical implications for legal professionals in determining when a statement could be considered reliable or not will be discussed.
